			LivingPath is a tool designed to make typographic forms more fluid and constantly evolving. Rather than drawing new shapes, it generates alternatives that allow the characters to adapt to new contexts. In this context, choosing open-source input typefaces is crucial, both legally and because they were originally designed to offer freedom, just like a stream following its own path without restrictions.
