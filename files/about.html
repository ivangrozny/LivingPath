			LivingPath is a tool designed to make typographic forms <br> more fluid and constantly evolving. Rather than drawing new <br> shapes, it generates alternatives that allow the characters <br>to adapt to new contexts. In this basis, choosing open-source <br> input typefaces is crucial legally and also because they <br> were originally designed to offer freedom, just like a stream <br> following its own path without restrictions.
