			If you have a new transformation idea, it is easy to build a new layer on <br>
			the software. You can ask me to do it here : ivan@mailoo.org or you can do it <br>
			with a fork on github.

			Rather than drawing new shapes, LivingPath generates alternatives that allow characters to adapt to new contexts. In this basis, choosing open-source input typefaces is crucial legally and also because they were originally designed to offer freedom, just like a stream following its own path without restrictions.
