Mac install : if app is "damaged" or doesn't open ( Unsigned Developers app )

If left-clic, [open] does not work :
- Place LivingPath.app in Applications folder
- Open the Terminal application (in your launchpad)
- Copy-paste in Terminal : sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LivingPath.app
- Press Enter (enter OS password if asked then press Enter)

if there is no error message after that, just run LivingPath from your Applications
